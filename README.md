# Echo

Echo is a custom Slay The Spire character with many conditional cards and unique mechanics. Designing good decks that
satisfy the card conditions will be challenging, but you can always duplicate another character to borrow some of their
powers.

## Data Collection

If you enable "Upload gameplay data" in the game settings, your gameplay data will be sent to a server anonymously. The
data sent is mostly the same as what you can find in the `runs` folder, but with the following extra fields:

- A list of mods you have enabled
- The current version of Echo mod
- Whether you have used basemod console commands in your run
- Which character you have chosen when duplicating

The data is used for debugging and balancing purposes. The generated statistics will be made public when there is enough
data.
